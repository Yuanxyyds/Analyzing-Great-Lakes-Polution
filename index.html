<h1 class="title toc-ignore">JSC370 Final Project - Identify and Monitor
the Most Phosphorous-Polluted Locations in the Great Lakes</h1>
<h4 class="author">Steven Liu</h4>

<div id="description-of-the-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Description of the Project</h2>
<p>This project focuses on investigating the water quality of the Great
Lakes region in North America, with a specific focus on phosphorus
levels in the water. This project mainly uses two datasets: 1) The water
quality dataset from <a
href="https://data-donnees.ec.gc.ca/data/substances/monitor/great-lakes-water-quality-monitoring-and-aquatic-ecosystem-health-data/great-lakes-water-quality-monitoring-and-surveillance-data/?lang=en">The
Canadian Open Data Portal</a>, and 2) The city dataset, obtained through
web scraping from <a
href="https://www.latlong.net/category/cities-236-15.html">Latlong</a>.
They explored and visualized the data using time series plots, boxplots,
and interactive maps. The results of their analysis showed that Lake
Erie and Lake Ontario have the highest phosphorus levels and are facing
more severe pollution issues than the other Great Lakes. They also
identified specific cities with the worst water quality, such as
Hamilton, ON, Canada; Niagara Falls, NY, USA; Toledo, OH, USA; Sandusky,
OH, USA; and Cleveland, OH, USA. Furthermore, they have investigated
whether there is evidence of improvement in water quality at the
identified locations from 2000 to the present. they have found no
evidence of improvement and, in fact, have identified a worsening trend
in water quality over time, especially for the west-coast cities.
Overall, this research paper provides valuable insights into the water
quality issues in the Great Lakes region and can inform future efforts
to improve water quality in the area.</p>

<div id="showcasing-plots" class="section level2 tabset">
<h2 class="tabset">Showcasing plots</h2>
<p>The following are the four main interactive figures that display the
results of this research:</p>
<p>Figure 1 illustrates the Adjusted Time Series for the Mean
Phosphorous Levels of the Great Lakes, depicting the trend of
phosphorous levels in the lakes from 2000 to the present.</p>
<p>Figure 2 (Leflet 1) presents the average phosphorous levels for each
observation station (shown by dots) in all Great Lakes, highlighting the
top 10 polluted stations using markers.</p>
<p>Figure 3 (Leflet 2) displays the average phosphorous levels for each
city (represented by dots) near Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, labeling the
top 5 polluted cities with markers.</p>
<p>Figure 4 shows the Heatmap for Phosphorous Levels over time by City,
demonstrating the phosphorous levels of cities near Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario from 2000 to the present.</p>
