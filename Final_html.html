<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Great Lakes are a group of five interconnected freshwater lakes
located in North America, consisting of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron,
Erie, and Ontario. As the world’s largest freshwater system, the Great
Lakes hold approximately 20% of the world’s freshwater and serve as a
vital source of drinking water for human and diverse array of plant and
animal species. However, the rapid growth in industrialization,
urbanization has caused considerable damage to the Great Lakes. Starting
early 1900s, Industrial waste from factories and mills along the Great
Lakes, the overuse of pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture, led to
a higher presence of chemical contaminants in the Great Lakes which can
have a significant impact on human health.</p>
<p>As the main chemical contaminants, the excess of Phosphorus can lead
to harmful algal blooms and other negative impacts on water quality.
When high levels of phosphorus enter a lake, either from agricultural
runoff, wastewater discharges, or other sources, it can trigger the
growth of harmful algae, which can deplete oxygen levels in the water
and create “dead zones” where fish and other aquatic life cannot
survive. As a standard, the concentration of Phosphorus should below 0.1
mg/L.</p>
<p>The worsen in Great Lakes’ water quality began to draw government’s
attention in 1970s. The United States and Canada signed <a
href="https://www.epa.gov/glwqa">The Great Lakes Water Quality
Agreement</a>, to establish a framework for cooperative efforts to
monitor and improve the water quality of the Great Lakes. The agreement
sets targets for reducing pollutants, promoting sustainable development,
and protecting biodiversity in the region.</p>
<p>As a result of the agreement, significant progress has been made in
reducing pollution and improving water quality in the Great Lakes. The
levels of some pollutants, such as PCBs and mercury, have decreased, and
efforts to address invasive species and habitat restoration have helped
to improve the health of the lakes’ ecosystems. However, some reports
stated, there are still ongoing threats to the Great Lakes, including
nutrient pollution, and emerging contaminants, which highlight the need
for continued collaboration and action to protect this vital resource.
As a reaction, the Canadian government had built hundreds of water
detection stations and collect data seasonally from 2000 to present
about the Water quality and ecosystem health data to long-termly monitor
the health of Great Lakes.</p>
<p>The dataset, <a
href="https://data-donnees.ec.gc.ca/data/substances/monitor/great-lakes-water-quality-monitoring-and-aquatic-ecosystem-health-data/great-lakes-water-quality-monitoring-and-surveillance-data/?lang=en">The
Great Lakes Water Quality Monitoring and Surveillance Data</a>, contains
records on centration levels of all the chemical contaminants, as well
as the regular statistic about Lakes (i.e. Lake Depth, Lake PH) ranging
from 2000 to present in Lake Erie, Lake Superior, Lake Ontario and Lake
Erie (Lake Michigan’s data is missing).</p>
<p>In this report, <strong>we mainly focus on analyzing the phrosphorous
level in the Great Lakes</strong> and seek to answer the following
question based on The Great Lakes Water Quality Monitoring and
Surveillance Data: <strong>In which locations/cities of the Great Lakes
have the worst water qualities and is there an improvement in water
quality in these mostly polluted locations from 2000 to
present?</strong> Specifically, we will use the concentration of
Phosphorus as the water quality indicator to trace the level of
Phosphorus from 2000 to present at different locations.</p>
</div>
<div id="method" class="section level1">
<h1>Method</h1>
<p>In order to answer the research question, we perform an analysis that
mainly follows methods that are full explained in: <a
href="#data-collection---data-reading-and-web-scraping">Data Collection
- Data Reading and Web Scraping</a>, <a href="#data-cleaning">Data
Cleaning</a>, <a href="#data-summary-and-merging">Data Summary and
Merging</a>, and <a href="#data-exploration-and-visualization">Data
Exploration and Visualization</a>. The <a href="#results">Results</a>
section provides additional method to interpret these data.</p>
<div id="data-collection---data-reading-and-web-scraping"
class="section level3">
<h3>Data Collection - Data Reading and Web Scraping</h3>
<p>The Canadian Open Data Portal provides 5 separate, downloadable
<code>csv</code> files <a
href="https://data-donnees.ec.gc.ca/data/substances/monitor/great-lakes-water-quality-monitoring-and-aquatic-ecosystem-health-data/great-lakes-water-quality-monitoring-and-surveillance-data/?lang=en">online</a>
about the Great Lakes water quality monitoring data. Each file contains
data for a single Great Lake, except for Lake Michigan, which is not
part of the Great Lakes Surveillance Program, and Georgian Bay, which
has a separate file from Lake Huron. These raw data files are simply
loaded separately by <code>read.csv</code>, and then bind together as a
full raw dataset named <code>water</code> by <code>rbind</code>. The raw
data <code>water</code> contains 1338620 observations of 22
variables.</p>
<p>Since the <code>water</code> dataset does not include detailed
geometric information for each water surveillance station, such as their
closest city, a second dataset has been introduced. This dataset
collects the name, latitude, and longitude of all cities and possibly
some towns in the USA and Canada, which is useful for interpretation. To
get these data, we perform web scraping from <a
href="https://www.latlong.net/">LatLong</a>. Four keywords we used in
searching data are <a
href="https://www.latlong.net/category/cities-40-15.html">“Canada
Cities”</a>, “Canada Towns”, “USA Towns” and <a
href="https://www.latlong.net/category/cities-236-15.html">“USA
Cities”</a>. All of these data are in tables within 16 different
<code>HTML</code> pages, we use <code>read_html</code> and
<code>html_table</code> to read the table content in each page, and use
<code>bind_rows</code> to efficiently bind these tables into one
dataset, <code>city</code>.</p>
<p>In addition, we manually added the geometric locations of some ports
to <code>city</code>, and for each lake, we added three locations (the
center, west, and east) to <code>city</code>. The raw dataset
<code>city</code> contains 1526 observations of 3 variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
<p>Table 1 below displays the first 5 rows of the dataset
<code>water</code>, providing an initial overview of the dataset and
highlighting potential cleaning steps. Firstly, we observed that the
<code>STN_DATE</code> column in the raw data is not formatted correctly
to be converted into a <code>yearmon</code> object. To resolve this, we
converted all <code>STN_DATE</code> values into <code>YYYY-MM</code>
format and saved them as <code>yearmon</code> type. Furthermore, for
future convenience, we extracted the <code>year</code> and
<code>month</code> from <code>STN_DATE</code> and saved them as separate
integer variables.</p>

<p>Our analysis revealed that the number of records in our dataset is
unevenly distributed between the years 2000 to 2023. To address this
issue, we introduced a new categorical variable called
<code>range</code>, which categorizes each observation into one of five
time periods: “2000-2005,” “2005-2010,” “2010-2015,” “2015-2020,” and
“2020-present.” Additionally, to ensure consistency in our labeling, we
re-categorized all observations originally labeled as “Georgian Bay” to
“Lake Huron.” This adjustment provides a more accurate representation of
our data.</p>
<p>Looking closer to the data, we removed all rows with missing values
in our primary variables of interest. Further details about these
variables can be found in the <a href="#data-summary-and-merging">Data
Summary and Merging</a> section. We also treated <code>VALUE</code>
entries of zero as missing values and removed them from our dataset.
During our analysis, we used Google Maps to verify the longitude values
and found that they were negative in the raw dataset. To correct this,
we multiplied all longitude values by a factor of -1. Additionally, the
longitude and latitude values for each water station varied slightly
over the years. To ensure consistency, we calculated the mean value of
longitude and latitude across all years for each station. These
adjustments ensure that our data is accurate and standardized for
analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, to focus our analysis on phosphorus levels, we filtered our
dataset into <code>water_phos</code> to only include observations where
the FULL_NAME chemical name was either “PHOSPHOROUS,TOTAL” or “TOTAL
PHOSPHOROUS”. These two names represent the same chemical, but it was
named “PHOSPHOROUS,TOTAL” before 2015 and “TOTAL PHOSPHOROUS” afterward.
We define phosphorous level &lt; 0.1 as Good, 0.1 &lt;= phosphorous
level &lt; 0.25, and phosphorous level &gt;= 0.25 as Very Bad.</p>
<p>The <code>city</code> dataset, obtained through web scraping,
contains information about towns and cities in Canada and the USA.
However, we only required information about cities located near the
Great Lakes. To reduce computation costs and improve relevance, we
filtered the dataset into <code>city_lake</code> to only include cities
within a specific geographic range. Specifically, we retained cities
located between “Ottawa, ON, Canada”, “Winkler, MB, Canada”, “Mansfield,
OH, USA”, and “Fermont, QC, Canada”.</p>

<h3>Data Summary and Merging</h3>
<p>To improve the readability and clarity of our datasets, we renamed
all primary variables. The Table 2 below shows a summary of all primary
variables and their corresponding descriptions. After undergoing the
data cleaning process, our clean dataset <code>water_phos</code> now

<p><br> Next, we will merge the <code>water_phos</code> and
<code>lake_city</code> datasets to create a larger dataset called
<code>water_phos_with_city</code>. To achieve this, we will use the
<code>crossing</code> function in <code>dplyr</code> to create an
intermediate dataframe containing all possible combinations of water
data and city data. For each possible combination, we will calculate the
Euclidean distance between the city and water station using the
following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{distance} = \sqrt{(\text{lat} -
\text{lat_city})^2 + (\text{lon} - \text{lon_city})^2}\]</span></p>
<p>After calculating the distance, we will use the <code>group_by</code>
function to group each station and select the <code>min(distance)</code>
as the closest city to that station. Table 3 below presents the 5 random
rows of the resulting <code>water_phos_with_city</code> dataset.</p>

<h3>Data Exploration and Visualization</h3>
<p>After obtaining the clean and valid <code>water_phos_with_city</code>
dataset, we can investigate patterns in the data. Our first task is to
identify which Great Lakes are mostly polluted and which ones are clean.
To accomplish this, we will create two time series plots that show the
mean phosphorus level of each Great Lake over time. The first plot will
be generated by grouping our dataset by lake and yearmon. While this
plot provides more detailed information about how each lake’s phosphorus
level changes over months, it may be misleading if some months have
fewer data points. To account for this, we will include a second plot
generated by grouping the data by lake and year, which will provide a
smoother representation of the data but with less details. We present
both plots in Figure 1 and Figure 2 below: <br></p>

<br> We will now visualize the phosphorus values for each individual
station using <code>leaflet</code>. Each station will be represented as
a circle on the leaflet map at its corresponding latitude and longitude
coordinates, with a color scale ranging from green to red to represent
its phosphorus value. The phosphorous value for each station is computed
by taking the mean value of all the observation from that station in the
selected time period. We provide four different time periods by variable
<code>range</code>, plus additional one with the grand mean for that
station over 2000-present. Besides, for each lake, we add 10 markers to
identify the 10 most polluted station in this lake. Note that the only
stations we are considering are stations with data more than 3 years.

<p><br> To improve the geometrical interpretation of the data, we will
create a second leaflet to visualize the phosphorus values grouped by
city. This leaflet will focus on Lake Ontario and Lake Erie only. As
each city may have multiple stations in water_phos_with_city, we will
compute the average latitude and longitude of these stations to
represent the city. Similarly, we will compute the average phosphorus
value for each city based on all observations during the selected time
period. The variable range provides four different time periods, plus an
additional one with the grand mean from 2000 to the present. In
addition, we will add five markers to identify the five most polluted
cities in each lake. Note that the only cities we are considering are
cities with data more than 3 years. <br></p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The primary research question that motivates this study is: ‘Which
locations/cities in the Great Lakes region have the worst water quality,
and is there evidence of improvements in water quality at these
locations from 2000 to the present?’ To address the first part of this
question, we compare the average phosphorus levels across the different
Great Lakes. Referring to both <a href='#Fig1'>Figure 1-2</a> and
<a href='#lf1'>Leaflet 1</a>, we can identify Lake Erie as having the
highest average phosphorus level, followed by Lake Ontario with the
second-highest average. Meanwhile, the other two lakes have
significantly lower phosphorus levels than these two.</p>
<p>To verify that Lake Ontario and Lake Erie are the two most polluted
lakes in terms of phosphorus levels, we examine the boxplot in
<a href='#Fig3'>Figure 3</a>. The median phosphorus level for Lake Erie
and Lake Ontario is evidently higher than for Lake Huron and Lake
Superior. Furthermore, the boxplot reveals a right skew for data from
Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, indicating that these two lakes have more
samples that have been detected as ‘very bad.’ Taken together, these
findings suggest that <strong>Lake Erie and Lake Ontario are facing more
severe pollution issues than the other Great Lakes</strong>. The average
phosphorous level for these Great Lakes are summarized in Table 4 below.

<p><br> In order to identify where the extreme phosphorus values for
Lake Ontario and Lake Erie are located in <a href='#Fig3'>Figure 3</a>,
we take a closer look at the <a href='#lf2'>Leaflet 2</a> to visualize
the data by city. We observe that the West Coast of both lakes has a
darker color, indicating worse water quality. Some of the most polluted
cities include Hamilton, ON, Canada; Niagara Falls, NY, USA; Toledo, OH,
USA; Sandusky, OH, USA; and Cleveland, OH, USA. If there are multiple
polluted cities located close to each other, we only select one to
interpret the data. It is worth noting that Toronto, ON, Canada, which
is a major city in Canada, is also listed as one of the most polluted
cities in some time periods.</p>

<p><br> Based on the summary statistics for mean phosphorous level in
the selected cities presented in Table 5 and the Heatmap in Figure 4, it
is evident that, with the exception of Toronto, all other cities have
significantly higher phosphorous levels than the average value for their
respective lakes in Table 4. Moreover, these cities consistently have
darker colors in most time periods in <a href='#lf2'>Leaflet 2</a>,
indicating a higher level of pollution. Therefore, we can conclude that
the <strong>west coasts of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario are the most
polluted areas from 2000 to present</strong>. Including the following
cities: Hamilton, ON, Canada; Niagara Falls, NY, USA; Toledo, OH, USA;
Sandusky, OH, USA; Detroit Lake, OH; and Cleveland, OH, USA.</p>
<p>Secondly, we will investigate whether there is evidence of
improvement in water quality at the identified locations from 2000 to
the present. To address this question, we will start by examining
<a href='#lf1'>Leaflet 1 and 2</a>. By choosing different time periods,
we notice that the colors for the periods 2015-2020 and 2020-present are
significantly darker than that of 2000-2005. This change is especially
noticeable at the west coasts of Lake Ontario and the entire Lake Erie,
where we identified as the most polluted areas.</p>
<p>Another evidence of worsening water quality over time is shown in
<a href='#Fig1'>Figure 2</a>. Initially, Lake Erie had an average
phosphorus value around 0.013 in 2000, and it eventually reached around
0.02 near 2020, especially for the time after 2015. Both Lake Ontario
and Lake Erie show a constant increase in water pollution. Regarding the
question of improvement, we can conclude that there is no evidence of
improvement in water quality for the identified locations from 2000 to
the present.</p>
<p>To test whether there is an evidence of decreasing water quality
among these areas, we will add separate linear fit to these cities
(Shown in the Figure 4 below).</p>

<p><br> Based on the Linear Model summary in the Table 6 above, it
verified that the water quality is quite consistent at Centre Lake
Ontario. But for west coasts, it shows a positive relationship between
Cleveland, Hamilton and Sandusky with p-value less than 0.05 (or near
0.05). the p-value (0.67) for the overall water quality in Toledo
rejects the linear relationship. However, by examining the scatter plot
of phosphorus levels over time for Toledo, we can observe a non-linear
relationship, with strong evidence of worsening water quality after
2015. Based on these information, we can answer the second part of the
research question that: <strong>For those most polluted cities, which
are in west coast of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, the water quality is
getting even worse by years.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="conclution-and-summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclution and Summary</h2>
<p>The study aims to identify the locations in the Great Lakes region
with the worst water quality and whether there is evidence of
improvements from 2000 to the present. The study finds that Lake Erie
and Lake Ontario are facing more severe pollution issues than other
Great Lakes. Especially for the west coast of the Lake Ontario and the
west coast of the Lake Erie, including the cities: Hamilton, Niagara
Falls, Toledo, Sandusky, Detroit Lake, and Cleveland. There is a
positive relationship between phosphorus levels and time for these
west-coast cities. The study concludes that the water quality is getting
even worse by years for those most polluted cities on the west coast of
Lake Ontario and Lake Erie.</p>
<p>The result suggests that efforts to improve water quality in these
polluted areas may not have been effective or sufficient to reverse the
trend of increasing phosphorus levels in recent years. Further
investigations into the causes of the increasing phosphorus levels and
the effectiveness of past and current interventions are warranted to
address this issue.</p>
</div>
<div id="future-steps" class="section level2">
<h2>Future Steps</h2>
<p>Based on the current results, we would like to further investigate
the causes of the increasing phosphorus level in these cities. In the
future studies, we might want to add some new dataset such as the
population of the city, number of factories of the city, to test whether
there exists some relationship between the phosphorus level and these
factors.</p>
